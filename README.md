## Challenge summary

For this challenge we were able to use several resources to find numerical results. In order to change this code for another elections here are my suggestions: 

1. Changing data base and modify variables to increase the information so we can check some important data as age of voters, social status etc, so next campaing could be focus in principal voters and increase confidence and votes. 
2. Adding "civil township" variable so we can analyse wich township in counties increase votes or decrease them, so campaigns can be changed in those sections in which there was a greater abstinence of votes.
